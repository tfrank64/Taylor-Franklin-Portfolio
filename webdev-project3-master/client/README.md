**Technical Requirements:**

Your entire project must use HTML5 and JavaScript.  Specifically:

* The game must use the HTML5 Canvas to display its graphics.
* The game must use JavaScript for all gameplay actions, movements, etc.
* The game page cannot ever reload.

You must use JQuery for the following:

* Any time anything new appears on the game.
* Any time anything disappears.
* Any AJAX calls.

You may use node.js for this project.  
All pages must utilize CSS to make it look good.  Poor design will cause points to be lost.
Milestone 1 does NOT require it to be on Facebook yet.
